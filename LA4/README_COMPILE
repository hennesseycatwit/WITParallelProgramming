These compile lines are meant to show what actions the makefile will perform

EXAMPLE COMPILE LINES FOR C:

g++ -I/usr/include/opencv  -c imageTools.cpp -lstdc++ -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc
gcc -c  imageTest.c
g++ -I/usr/include/opencv  imageTools.o -lstdc++ -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc imageTest.o -o test.x


EXAMPLE COMPILES LINES FOR FORTRAN:

g++ -I/usr/include/opencv  imageTools.cpp -lstdc++ -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc -c
gfortran -c imgBinding.f90 imageTest.f90
gfortran -o testF.x imageTools.o -lstdc++ -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc  imageTest.o imgBinding.o

Notice that the C++ object file (imageTools.o) can be linked into a Fortran program. This will work as long as the same
compiler suite is used to create all of the object files. This feature is called interoperability and many languages can
interoperate with each other.
